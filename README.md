# One MDM

## What is One MDM?

One MDM is an open source Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution. It can be used to manage Android devices registered to the server after installing the [one-mdm-client](https://github.com/multunus/one-mdm-client) application.

## How to set up One MDM?

In order to use One MDM, you have to host this One MDM server (which is a [Sails JS](http://sailsjs.org/) application). Also the client application to be installed has to be built with necessary configurations to point to this server (Details can be found on the [one-mdm-client](https://github.com/multunus/one-mdm-client) page).
